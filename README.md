Youtube2HTML5
=================

The support for HTML5 in YouTube is still in beta and, as so, the YouTube interface does not provide a way to switch between Flash and HTML5. So we tought we could make a quick  and cool button for doing so.

<!--

But still, you may ask, why the need to always use HTML5 instead of normal Flash. Well, due to what may only be seen as an Orwellian decision from our faculty system admins, the access to Flash streams has been drastically throttled, making the use of the HTML5 version of Youtube mandatory. -->
