Youtube2HTML5
=================


![](https://github.com/cesarferreira/youtube2html5/blob/master/images/screenshot.png)

The support for HTML5 in YouTube is still in beta and, has so, the YouTube interface does not provide a way to switch between Flash and HTML5. To use HTML5 the user has to add the tag &html5=1 to the end of the URL, which is not an overcomplicated task, but it is always faster and cooler to have a quick button for doing so.
But still, you may ask, why the need to always use HTML5 instead of normal Flash. Well, due to what may only be seen as an Orwellian decision from our faculty system admins, the access to Flash streams has been drastically throttled, making the use of the HTML5 version of Youtube mandatory.

Finally, this extension has been released as open source so please share any changes you make. Bug reports are always welcome and please do not forget this was created on our free time and just for the kicks.
